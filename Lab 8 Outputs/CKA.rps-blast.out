S.townsendi_ETNK1_ethanolamine_kinase_1	369	56	296	6.44e-16	pfam01636, APH, Phosphotransferase enzyme family.  This family consists of bacterial antibiotic resistance proteins, which confer resistance to various aminoglycosides they include: aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase or kanamycin kinase / neomycin-kanamycin phosphotransferase and streptomycin 3''-kinase or streptomycin 3''-phosphotransferase. The aminoglycoside phosphotransferases inactivate aminoglycoside antibiotics via phosphorylation. This family also includes homoserine kinase. This family is related to fructosamine kinase pfam03881.
S.townsendi_CHKA_choline_kinase_alpha	457	139	374	3.97e-84	pfam01633, Choline_kinase, Choline/ethanolamine kinase.  Choline kinase catalyzes the committed step in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine by the CDP-choline pathway. This alignment covers the protein kinase portion of the protein.
