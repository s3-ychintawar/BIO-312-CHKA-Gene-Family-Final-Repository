1 pfam00026, Asp, Eukaryotic aspartyl protease.  Aspartyl (acid) proteases include pepsins, cathepsins, and renins. Two-domain structure, probably arising from ancestral duplication. This family does not include the retroviral nor retrotransposon proteases (pfam00077), which are much smaller and appear to be homologous to a single domain of the eukaryotic asp proteases.
2 pfam01633, Choline_kinase, Choline/ethanolamine kinase.  Choline kinase catalyzes the committed step in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine by the CDP-choline pathway. This alignment covers the protein kinase portion of the protein. The divergence of this family makes it very difficult to create a model that specifically predicts choline/ethanolamine kinases only. However if pfam01633 is also present then it is definitely a member of this family.
3 pfam01636, APH, Phosphotransferase enzyme family.  This family consists of bacterial antibiotic resistance proteins, which confer resistance to various aminoglycosides they include: aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase or kanamycin kinase / neomycin-kanamycin phosphotransferase and streptomycin 3''-kinase or streptomycin 3''-phosphotransferase. The aminoglycoside phosphotransferases inactivate aminoglycoside antibiotics via phosphorylation. This family also includes homoserine kinase. This family is related to fructosamine kinase pfam03881.
4 pfam14543, TAXi_N, Xylanase inhibitor N-terminal.  The N- and C-termini of the members of this family are jointly necessary for creating the catalytic pocket necessary for cleaving xylanase. Phytopathogens produce xylanase that destroys plant cells, so its destruction through proteolysis is vital for plant-survival.
